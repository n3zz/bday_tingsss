            <p>Nah but seriously dude! Look at you! 18 already and doing more stuff than ever :D! I have never been so happy to vibe with someone as you my dude. You really are my brother from another mother.
            Like seriously dude <i>bro hug infinite</i>. You may not think like it, but Ramone you really did clutch this server through. You were one of the people who I could really trust with the server.
            You helped me get this server on its feet. You helped me with the whole moderation stuff. The charity stream with was a complete honour doing with you mate. You made the landing page of the website.
            You helped the server be what it is today. And above all that, you are such a gem of a friend. I really can't thank you enough for helping me along this. You know I really dont believe in religion,
            but I bet your father looking above from the highest of the heavens, is so proud of you. We all as a server and dare I say to some extent, a family are so proud of you.

            <br>Truly mate, when we first vibed in TCS Experience Work, I knew that it was a starting of a bomb friendship. One that involves our surreal humour and <i>c o m e d i i</i>, deep convos, tilted moments in valorant and gogo cs.
            When we stopped talking after that it felt pretty bland, and I thought its probably again just one of those short lived moments, but then at that day, when I invited you to The Pseudo Dopamine Centre. Just for a game of counter strike (GOGOCS). I had the best belly laughs in days.
            We just kept vibing after that day after day. I may be the owner, but you are the one that really carried us, and made some the best moments I will cherish forever. Here's to more life for you, this friendship and the server.
            Seriously man, Happy Birthday dude! You deserve every single bit of this day, if not more :)</br>

            <br>Here are a few gifts in return man :D</br>
